    <h3>This is a general testing HTML file.</h3>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph.
      <mark>I think it needs to be added that the set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense.</mark>
      I have selected those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules, in my opinion.
    </p>

    <div>
      This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead of paragraph markup for various reasons.
      (End of <code>div</code>.)
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is a <i>block quotation</i> containing a single paragraph. Well, not quite, since this is not
        <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you understand the point. After all, this page does not use HTML markup
        very normally anyway.
      </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph before an <strong>unordered</strong> list (<code>ul</code>). Note that the spacing between a
      paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs
      are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>One.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>
        Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for short items lists look better if they are
        compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Four. This is the last item in this list Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
