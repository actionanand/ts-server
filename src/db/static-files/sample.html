    <h3>This is a general testing HTML file.</h3>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph.
      <mark
        >I think it needs to be added that the set of elements tested is not
        exhaustive in any sense.</mark
      >
      I have selected those elements for which it can make sense to write user
      style sheet rules, in my opinion.
    </p>

    <div>
      This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead
      of paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is a <i>block quotation</i> containing a single paragraph. Well,
        not quite, since this is not <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you
        understand the point. After all, this page does not use HTML markup very
        normally anyway.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph before an <strong>unordered</strong> list
      (<code>ul</code>). Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list
      before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't
      guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list
      header".
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>One.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>
        Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for
        short items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas
        for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between
        items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Four. This is the last item in this list Let us terminate the list now
        without making any more fuss about it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
